# Changelog

What each release brought into the running app. Newest first.

A "release" is one run of `update-capital-command.bat`: it merges `dev` into
`main`, rebuilds, and restarts the server. Until you run it, nothing here has
reached the app you use — that is the whole point of the split.

Every change made in the sandbox adds a line under **Unreleased** before it is
committed. The release moves that block under a dated heading.

## Unreleased

- **The Stream Pipeline stops stalling, inventing and paying twice.** A run
  with no audio track, no whole-recording transcript, or a settled job with no
  moment used to sit "running" forever — one had been reading a transcript for
  five days. Those now settle or skip. A silent or music-only stream no longer
  produces six confident, schedulable posts about a stream that never happened:
  posts, carousels and visual moments require real spoken words. The same audio
  was being transcribed TWICE per run, concurrently — the most expensive thing a
  run does, doubled — and now the long-form project and the clip job share one
  transcript per source. Whisper moved off the main thread, so a half-hour
  stream no longer leaves the whole app answering nothing for fifteen minutes,
  and /pipeline responds in ~36ms warm instead of up to 6.6s. Plus loudness
  normalisation on the final mix, the hook anchored to first speech rather than
  second zero, and the redundant third copy of every clip deleted.

- **Sourceflow can now run a coordinated AI team by voice or text.** The new
  Sourceflow Agents screen sends a goal to Strategy, Research, Production and
  Operations agents through ChatGPT or Grok, combines their work into one plan,
  speaks the answer aloud, queues follow-up prompts, and keeps a durable run
  history. Agents can inspect the content workspace, but any idea save or new
  pipeline run waits in an approval inbox until Nic explicitly approves it.

- **A release actually replaces the running app.** Two bugs stopped it: the
  release script read the current branch into a variable that PowerShell treats
  as the same one as its own -Branch parameter, so it released main into main;
  and a .next link left by an older layout was reused without checking where it
  pointed, so the build wrote to one folder while its dependency link was made
  beside another and the server came up unable to find react/jsx-runtime.

- **Instagram and Facebook post clips queued before hosting was set up.** An
  item with no hosted copy could never satisfy the two platforms that pull the
  video from a URL, so it failed forever on a clip sitting right there on
  disk. It uploads the clip at post time instead.

## 2026-08-02

The evening that started with "none of the buttons are clicking".

- **Buttons work again.** The app was serving a page whose client never
  started, so the sidebar rendered but nothing responded. Two separate causes,
  both fixed: a build that put two copies of React in one bundle, and an
  11 MB payload the browser had to parse before anything became clickable.
- **Overlay pictures moved out of the app-data file.** One watermark is 476 KB
  of base64 and it was copied into all 18 clip projects that used it — 8.6 MB
  of a 12.5 MB file that gets rewritten on every save and sent to the browser
  on every page load. They live on disk now, named by content hash, so one
  watermark is one file. `/api/bootstrap` went from 11.0 MB to 2.2 MB.
- **The build stopped resolving React from other checkouts.** `.next` is only
  relocated out of OneDrive for checkouts actually inside OneDrive, and the
  dependency link it needs is per-checkout instead of shared by all fifteen
  worktrees on the machine.
- **Capital Command opens as a desktop app.** `Capital Command.bat`, a Desktop
  and Start Menu shortcut (`npm run app:shortcut`), and a web manifest so
  Chrome offers to install it properly. Closing the window leaves the server
  running, because the publish runner and Threads autopilot post through it.
- **Production and sandbox are separate copies.** The folder that runs the
  workflow stays on `main` and is never edited; work happens in
  `%USERPROFILE%\capital-command-dev` on `dev`, port 3100, with its own data
  folder and its posting credentials disarmed.
- **The test suite is hermetic.** It used to read whatever sat next to it —
  including the real YouTube refresh token, which one test asserted against.
  Data paths, environment and timezone are all pinned now. 84 files, 820 tests.
- **`npm test` runs the whole suite.** It used to compile one file and print
  "portfolio calculation tests passed", which is how a green `npm test` sat
  next to a dozen failures.
