## Stream Pipeline (`/pipeline`)

One stream in (VOD link or uploaded file) → every format out, ready to
schedule. `src/lib/pipeline/runs.ts` is the orchestrator: a run stores a
shared clips source id plus references into the existing subsystems (the
long-form project, the clip job, the carousel, the publish queue) — it owns
no media of its own. `runOverview` both reports and ADVANCES the run
(auto-export the long-form edit when analysis is ready, extract the MP3 from
the finished export, write the carousel + text posts from the transcript),
so polling `GET /api/pipeline` is what drives runs forward and every step is
idempotent behind an id check.

- When a NEW output format is added to the app, wire it into the pipeline:
  a stage in `runs.ts` (+ `types.ts`), a row in
  `src/components/pipeline/pipeline-page.tsx`, and a count in the
  scheduler-stage summary.

## Long-form topic segments vs short-form clips

A stream is several videos. `src/lib/longform/topics.ts` reads the transcript
and splits the recording into the 3-5 subjects it actually covered (lexical
cohesion — vocabulary turnover marks where one subject ends), each one roughly
ten minutes and each exportable as its own long-form upload. `projectForTopic`
in `plan.ts` renders one by clipping the project's timeline to that window and
moving the hook onto its opening, so segments go through the SAME export engine
as the full edit (cuts, captions, overlays, mix) and nothing downstream needs a
special case.

- Topic segments and short-form clips are independent selections over the same
  transcript, and must stay that way: the Clip Generator scans the whole stream
  for its best 30-second moments wherever they fall; topic segments carve the
  stream into whole subjects. Neither constrains the other.
- Topics need a transcript of the WHOLE recording. Long-form analysis only
  transcribes the opening of a long source (that is all the hook needs), so
  `planProjectTopics` falls back to the full transcript the clip job made from
  the same `sourceId`; the pipeline plans the segments once that lands.
- Segments are planned automatically but rendered on demand — auto-rendering
  five ten-minute videos per stream is hours of encoding nobody asked for.

## Clip metadata conventions (titles, descriptions, tags)

Clip titles are NEVER raw transcript fragments — a slice of what was said
reads as a broken, mid-sentence thought. Titles are written by Claude in
`src/lib/clipping/titles.ts`, which carries the channel's title style guide:
a system prompt with example titles plus the recurring keyword set (AI, vibe
coding, Claude, ChatGPT, AI agents, coding, SaaS, startup, business,
building in public, engineering, automation). The heuristic titler in
`src/lib/clipping/editor.ts` (`generateClipTitle`) is only the offline
fallback when no API key is configured or the call fails.

- Apply the SAME approach to any future clip/video metadata generation —
  descriptions, tags, hashtags: reuse `CHANNEL_KEYWORDS` and
  `TITLE_STYLE_EXAMPLES` from `titles.ts` and write viral, keyword-aware
  copy with Claude rather than slicing the transcript.
- Every generated clip shows its title in white text centered just above
  the video band (over the blurred fill) by default: the ready-to-post
  render burns it in (`writeClipDownloadAss` + `buildClipTitleDialogue` in
  `captions.ts`), and fresh editor projects seed the matching white text
  overlay (`makeTitleOverlay`).

## Remotion / motion video conventions

When asked to make a "motion video" (a new Remotion short/segment), the
video is not done until it's wired into the app's Segment Deck, not just
committed as a standalone project under `video/`.

- Standalone Remotion projects live under `video/<project-name>/` (own
  `package.json`, `Root.tsx`, `Video.tsx`, `src/scenes/`, `src/components/`)
  — see `video/vibe-coding-first-steps/` as the reference layout.
- The Segment Deck (`src/app/presentation/deck.tsx`) is the in-app viewer —
  a `PROJECTS` array of `{ id, name, description, format, slides[] }`. It is
  NOT auto-discovered; every new video project must be added there manually:
  import each scene component and add a `Project` entry with one `Slide`
  per scene (id, title, note, component, durationInFrames).
- Note: `video/ai-price-war` and `video/free-ai-builds-intro` were never
  wired into the deck — don't treat their absence there as the pattern to
  follow; `vibe-coding-first-steps` (added in PR #155) is the example to
  copy.
- After wiring it in, verify by running the dev server, opening
  `/presentation`, selecting the new project tab, and confirming the
  Player actually renders/autoplays each scene — don't just rely on
  `tsc --noEmit`.
